# Module11-Challenge: UFOs
## Overview:
Using Javascript and HTML creates a table to organize UFO data, which can filter data based on certain criteria.
## Results:
![example]()
The photo above displays the example on filtering table with city "benton".
## Summary:
The table on webpage can filter the UFO data by 'Date', 'City', 'State', 'Country' and 'Shape'.  
### Drawback
The page cannot have a option to back the full table.
### Futher Development
In the future, the further work could have:
 - Adding a "add button" that client can add new data into table.
 - Adding a "delete button" that client can delete some data of table from dataset.
 - Adding a sorting option for table.
